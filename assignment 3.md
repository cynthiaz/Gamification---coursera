#Project Part III: Design Document

You are approached by Rashmi Horenstein, the CEO of ShareAll, a prominent company in the hot collaborative consumption space. (If you aren’t familiar with the concept, some good resources are CollaborativeConsumption.com and the March 9, 2013 cover story in the Economist.) She knows you are one of the top experts on gamification, which she has heard can revolutionize business.  She asks you to present a proposal for a gamified system to take her business to the next level.  

ShareAll’s mission is to make shared use of products and services as common as individual purchases.  It follows the path of companies such as AirBnB, Buzzcar, and Uber, which allow sharing of particular products (cars, housing, etc).  ShareAll’s patented technology makes it easy for consumers and business to share any product or service.  ShareAll has also developed a global virtual currency, called Shares, which can be used to purchase access to any asset in the system. Shares can be exchanged for real money, and users can generate more Shares by sharing items or volunteering their time to complete tasks for others. 

ShareAll charges a small transaction fee whenever Shares are generated, traded, or spent. Therefore, the more activity, the more money ShareAll makes. Horenstein tells you that she cares about the social benefits of sustainability.  However, ShareAll is a for-profit company, with investments and partnerships from some of the world’s largest corporations, so profits matter. Horenstein believes gamification could significantly help ShareAll’s business. She is eager to read your ideas. \

**Provide a detailed description of your proposal, organized according to the design framework described in the lectures in Unit 7:**

1.     Define business objectives
2.     Delineate target behaviors
3.     Describe your players
4.     Devise activity loops
5.     Don’t forget the fun!
6.     Deploy the appropriate tools

## Answer:

### 1.Define business objectives ###

The business objective of providing a gamified system for ShareAll is to generate more revenue by motivating users to share and trade products and services to increase the volume of activity. Achieving this should increase the market growth and its brand popularity amongst other competitors. The secondary goal is to create a social awareness of sustainability by promoting the social responsibilit and benefits of sharing. We want to encourage new and existing users to not only use but also share their own products to others with similar needs and feel good about it. 

### 2. Delineat target behaviors

The target behaviours that our system needs to generate can be summarized into the following measure of success:

- Get more involvement from new and existing users, which will increase the volume of activity(DAU/MAU) It should become a preferred method of exchange products and services online by having active transactions. This will directly increase our market share and generate more profit.
- Encourage people to participate in community building and begin inviting heir friends to join ShareAll to promote brand popularity. More users equals to more transactions.
- Establish a well trusted brand reputation to promote online transaction. Online exchange and trading may stimulate fraud which can damage the service’s reputation. Therefore, we need to provide an easy and worry-free user experience to users, so they feel reliable in doing more transactions with others. 

### 3. Describe players

The idea of ShareAll is to provide everyone a platform for sharing/trading that is accessible and reliable. However, our gamified system have a specific target group to yield better results. In practice, the majority of users are in the millennial generation who are digital natives, between 20-35. Normally they have stronger engagement in online services, they are familiar with online purchases and games, they are also more open minded and collaborative. Most of them have experiences with e-commerce and online community collaboration. In addition, they may be more conservative in spending, so they are more likely to be willing to share/reuse from strangers. 

Within this group, users of ShareAll can be categorized into 3 types:

- Achiever: people who enjoy looking for great deals, and more willing to buy stuff that meet their need. They may also feel satisfied when they have successfully shared/traded with others.
- Social: people who love to socialize and help others, also enjoy networking, and sharing knowledge and volunteering as a way of building their connection. Those users will likely to be more active on community discussion.
- Explorer: people who enjoy browsing and finding out what’s new. 

### 4. Devise the activity loop

At a macro level, we can utilize a progression loop to help people onboarding at their early stages, and drive them to become master contributors of ShareAll. For first time users, a progress bar or road map can guide them from start to end of their first sharing experience. We will reward points and give badges as they accomplishing various small tasks, such as completing their profile, putting up their first post etc. Further more, certain classes of badges will be unlocked once they have achieved their milestones. This is a similar experience as levelling up in playing games, this will get them engaged at an early stage during scaffolding.

At the micro level, the gamified system will have a well structured engagement loop that help motivate people to engage in using ShareAll, and will provide clear feedback upon their actions which will become a new form of motivation. Each time when they act as providers for sharing something, write a review, or volunteer to help someone to do work, the system will reward them points which them can use to redeem Share currency. As they participate more, they can accumulate more Shares that can exchange for real currency. To encourage them in community building, users will receive reward if they invite friends to register, participate in online discussion. Additionally, they can get special titles once they have made certain amount of contributions. They will also get rewarded if they receive certain amount of positive reviews. They can get reputation points as a way of promoting their services as well. Moreover, people like surprises; so we can integrate a process for people to vote for trustful players and the system will randomly send out free gifts to those players. 

### 5. Don't forget about the fun

By bringing more fun elements to the system, we can add some ‘game-like’ features into ShareAll:

- As a way of bringing more surprises and encourage people doing fair trade, we can open a virtual lottery every week or month that allows players to redeem their reputation points into a lottery to win Shares (currency). 
- Another example would be to similar to collecting achievements in WOW; where players can get achievement badges by completing different tasks, this well satisfies people who enjoy much in exploring new things. 
- People will get different amount of points depending on how fast they complete their transaction and the quality based on ratings. This randomness generates some level of challenge that can be fun to people who want to achieve more. 
- From a social aspect, we can also encourage people to take photographs when they have made a successful trade and post it online to promote sharing. Interactions with other players can also bring fun. 

### 6. Deploy the appropriate tools

In addition to all the specifics mentioned above, the gasified system will be adopting the following tools:

- It will have a website that people can interact with, publish their posts, participate in online forum, redeem their points etc. It should also have a mobile app for better accessibility, and where users can perform basic tasks such as finding deals that are close by.
- Online community: everyone can participate in community activities such as meetups, networking, Q&A..etc. A good social bonding is key to the virality of ShareAll.
- Dashboard:  the dashboard interface  illustrates their progress and achievements such as badges, points and Shares received. It also shows their reviews given by others as a way to promote relatedness.
