## Assignment 2 - Motivation

You are approached by Ryan Morrison, the mayor of a medium-sized city in the Midwest of the United States.  He has heard that you know a lot about gamification and believes that gamification techniques can transform city government.  

He would like to start with the health of city employees.  The city has 50,000 employees and they happen to have exactly the same rates of obesity as the U.S. average: 34.4% overweight (but not obese) and 33.9% of them are obese.  53.1% of the city’s employees do not meet the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines for aerobic physical activity and 76% of them fail to meet the Guidelines for muscle-strengthening activity.  The city pays for health benefits for its employees and this cost is a huge part of the city budget.  Economists in Mayor Morrison’s office have estimated that a 3% improvement in the average physical fitness of city employees would amount to a US$94 million reduction in annual city health costs; a 5% improvement would save US$188 million.  

Describe in general terms a gamified system that could effectively motivate behavior change to address the challenge presented above. Specifically, explain how the system would effectively incorporate intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, or both. Your answer should address the fact that this is an internal gamification project, targeted at the institutional goals of the city government.  The system can use any technology (or no technology!), so long as the resources required seem justified by the scope of the opportunity. 

##Answer

The objective of the gamified system is to effectively motivate city employees to develop a healthy lifestyle and to improve their physical fitness. Achieving the objective will also help the government to reduce the annual health costs. 

My approach to this challenge is to develop a path that can guide employees to move from being A Motivated to being intrinsically motivated based on the self-determination theory. First, we need to raise public awareness of obesity and its impact, we can leverage behavioural economics such as “power of defaults” to have employees subscribe to health related newsletters, workshops, etc. by setting the subscription option as default in the survey. Similar to “loss aversion”, we can also emphasize how unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle can be harmful their health, and what negative effects are there for being obese, so that people can be more alerted and be more willing to maintain a good health. 

In addition to that, we need to develop an intrinsic motivational system that reflects three characteristics: Competency, Autonomy and Relatedness. We can introduce a program that encourages participation in activities that involve fitness development, competitions and social gathering: 
an application that tracks their progress such as weight loss and other achievements, this provides them the feedback that's necessary for them to develop a positive loop. (Competency)
Everyone is given the flexibility to choose kinds of exercise and build their own fitness plan that satisfied their needs, so that they have a sense of making meaningful choices. (autonomy); 
Organize team events and competitions to have employees collaborate and compete with others to build a social bond, which helps them to reflect themselves and become more encouraged. (relatedness)

Along with these intrinsic motivations, some extrinsic motivators can also be used to better motivate people in accomplishing their goals, but they need to be well balanced to avoid the over justification effect that might cause demotivation in some cases:
offer certain incentives to employees such as a free wearable device that tracks their exercise progress
consider unexpected rewards for people who participate in activities to make the process more fun
incorporate some competitive elements such as leaderboard to reflect status
