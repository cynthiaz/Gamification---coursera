## Assignment 1

### Project Definition
You are an employee of Cereals Incorporated, a large manufacturer of breakfast food products.  Your supervisor, Madison County, approaches you because she knows you recently took a course on gamification, which she has heard will revolutionize marketing. She tells you that Cereals Inc. is about to release a new line of ready-to-eat breakfast pastries, and she wants to know whether to use gamification as part of the marketing strategy.  The breakfast pastries will be aimed at the 18-35 age bracket. Surveys show members of this demographic often skip breakfast because they donâ€™t want to eat the typical cereals of their youth, and they are too active to cook their own breakfasts.  Market research indicates that the pastries are likely to appeal more to women than men by a 65%-35% ratio. Cereals Inc. has a 35% share of the overall breakfast food market, but only a 10% share of the fragmented ready-to-eat segment.  

### Answer
The main challenges that Cereals Inc. is facing can be summarized into two key points:
1. Their target demographic aged between 18-35 often skip breakfast. People under this age group typically have busy life styles, and they don't always have time to cook breakfast.
2. Their market share in ready-to-eat segment is only 10%, indicating a low brand loyalty and less customer's returns.

Therefore, the business objective of Cereals Inc. is to promote their new product line, engaging their target audience and building brand loyalty in order to increase their market share in the ready-to-eat segment.

Gamification can be a useful technique to achieve great results in many ways, the followings explain why using appropriate elements can help address the challenges: 

1. It can motivate people to buy the pastries and reinforce a good habit of having breakfast by offering a gamified application that introduces elements such as virtual points, badges and progression so that people are immerse in a virtual journey to a healthy lifestyle as they actively interact with it. 
2. It can also bridge the engagement gap in order to engage more customers to buy the product by making the product consumption more fun and exciting, such as giving surprises, redeemable coupons or having people to 'problem-solve' a puzzle printed on the package. 
3. People under this age group are active in mobile apps and online communities. Using mobile app that allow people to invite friends, share their progress and gain recognition of their achievement can develop a very unique product experience and a positive brand image to gain brand loyalty.
